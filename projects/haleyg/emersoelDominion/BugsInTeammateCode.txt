Bug 1:
 Description: 2 assertion errors regarding the playing of the Smithy card: the hand size and deck size were not properly altered.
Steps to reproduce: run the test suite using the following command: make unittestresults.out. Open the newly created unittestresults.out and look for the card test 2: Smithy for the assertion errors.
Expected result:
1.  +3 cards to the hand of the player.
2.  -3 cards from the deck of the player.
Actual result: 
1. 3 cards not added to player's hand.
2. 3 cards not removed from players deck.
Bug 2:
 Description: 1 assertion error regarding the playing of the Village card: The player's action are not properly altered.
Steps to reproduce: run the test suite using the following command: make unittestresults.out. Open the newly created unittestresults.out and look for the card test 3: Village for the assertion error.
Expected result:
1.  2 player actions added.
Actual result: 
1. 2 player actions not added.
Bug 3:
 Description: 50 failures regarding the playing of the Council Room card due to hand count not properly altered.
Steps to reproduce: run the test suite using the following command: make unittestresults.out. Open the newly created unittestresults.out and look for the random test 2: council room card.
Expected result:
1. 50 successful council room plays.
Actual result: 
1. 50 council room failures.


From my test suite I was able to identify 3 bugs in my teammates dominion program. Bugs 1, 2 and 3 were fairly simple bugs that stemmed from an incorrect card/deck change or incorrect altered player actions after a certain card was played. Bugs 1 and 2 were identified by unit tests while bug 3 was identified from a random test. Due to the nature of bug 3, it still remains easily reproducible by the random test created for the Council Room card.
